# elAUTHant

Elauthant stand as a Postgres extension designed to streamline authentication within your database instance without any biases.

## Why?

In my previous projects, I've grappled with authentication tools like Firebase and Supabase. Despite their assurances, especially Supabase, they ended up complicating the authentication process rather than simplifying it. This frustration led me to create Elauthant. My sole aim is straightforward: authentication within my database, free from unnecessary complications.
